Bug Tracker is a web-based application designed to help organizations efficiently track and manage software bugs and issues. It provides a centralized platform for teams to report, prioritize, assign, and monitor the progress of bug fixes. With Bug Tracker, you can streamline your development process and ensure a smoother user experience for your software applications.

### Built With

Bug Tracker is built using the following major libraries and frameworks:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): A Node.js web application framework.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A NoSQL database for storing bug data.

## Features

Bug Tracker solves several key user problems, including:

1. **Efficient Bug Reporting:** Users can easily report bugs with detailed information, including steps to reproduce, screenshots, and priority levels.

2. **Team Collaboration:** Teams can collaborate by assigning bugs to specific team members, adding comments, and updating bug statuses.

3. **Priority Management:** Bugs can be categorized and prioritized based on severity, helping teams focus on critical issues first.
